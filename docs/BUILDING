Installation:

1) Download the CycleStreets repo from https://github.com/cyclestreets/ios

2) Checkout the route-me svn repo from google code from http://route-me.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ route-me-read-only

3) Open the CycleStreets project and open the Info window for the MapView.xcodeproj, re-link the project to the MapView.xcodeproj file in the route-me download. (ensure the path type is Relative to Project)

4) Select and copy the path attribute down to the MapView directory ie. 
for a path of ../../iPhone/libs/RouteMe/MapView/MapView.xcodeproj  copy ../../iPhone/libs/RouteMe/MapView

5) Open the MapView.xcodeproj and tick the dependency check box for libMapView.a

6) Double click the CycleSteets target and in the General Tab add a Direct Dependency to the MapView lib in MapView.xcodeproj

7) In the Build Tab add the copied MapView directory path to the User Header Search Paths entry and tick recursive.

8) Close the Target and open the Project Build Tab and add the same MapView directory path to the User Header Search Paths entry there too.

All should now compile fine with no Errors or Warnings.

Note:
We have 1 Static Analyser issue flagged with Route Me, Im currently of the thinking this is spurious.
